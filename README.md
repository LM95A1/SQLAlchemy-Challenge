# SQLAlchemy Challenge

*SQLAlchemy Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 10*

## Climate Analysis and Exploration
This repository consists of two main components:

* **Jupyter Notebook (`climate_analysis.ipynb`):**
This notebook includes all the exploratory data analysis steps, including precipitation and temperature analysis. It uses *Python, SQLAlchemy ORM, Pandas, and Matplotlib* to create visualizations and analyze the data.

* **Flask API script (`app.py`):**
This script uses *Flask* to serve the climate data through multiple API endpoints, providing access to precipitation data, station data, temperature observation data, and temperature statistics for a given date or date range. All routes return JSON data, which can be used by front-end applications.

## Files Included
- `climate_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for performing the climate analysis and data exploration (including dependencies).
- `app.py`: *Flask* API script for serving the climate data.
- `hawaii.sqlite`: *SQLite* database file containing climate data (contained in the *Resources* directory).

All scripts and notebooks were developed in a *Python* environment managed by *Anaconda*, with code written in *Visual Studio Code*.

Coding Soundtrack for this week's challenge was Architects' album, [For Those That Wish To Exist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcZMZxR9uxC-E2LSxEY1wevRTbob6XNjA).
